<h3>Step 1: Account Creation and Telnet Connection</h3>
In this project, I'll delve into Telnet, contrasting it with its more secure counterpart, SSH. To demonstrate Telnet's functionality, I'll connect to a remote device, tty.sdf.org. To initiate the process, I'll create an account on the website, which will then provide login credentials via email.

<h3>Step 2: Use Windows PowerShell To Telnet</h3>
Returning to Wireshark, I'll begin capturing traffic on port 23. To generate the traffic, I'll utilize Windows Powershell to telnet to the server. After inputting the username and password received via email, connection is established.
